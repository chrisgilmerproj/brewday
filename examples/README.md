## Types of Recipes

There are two types of recipes, those that end in `_objects.py` and those that
end in `_dict.py`.   Let's look at the differences with the Pale Ale recipe
examples:

### `pale_ale_objects.py`

Building a recipe using python objects.  This gives you full control over
making each and every element of a recipe.

### `pale_config_dict.py`

Building a recipe with a python dict.  This dict is parsed and any missing data
is pulled from a directory named `data/`.  You have full control over the
required elements but leaving out many of them will still cause the recipe to
work.
