Designing the Grain Bill
========================

This tutorial is going to show you how to design a grain bill for your beer.
Once the style is known you will want to decide how much of each grain to add
to get the Original Gravity you desire.  This can be done in a few easy steps.

Picking Original Gravity
------------------------

If we build a Pale Ale we might first want to pick an original gravity.  This
would be the driven primarily by the style of the beer and for a Pale Ale we
will pick 1.054.  This is the gravity you desire after you have steeped your
grains and added your malt extract.  This is largely driven by your Brew House
Efficiency, the start and final volume, and the types of grain you use
(cereals, malt extracts, etc).

In this example the start volume is 7.0 Gallons and the target OG in Gravity
Units (GU) is 54 GU.

:math:`\text{OG} = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{\text{Start Volume}}`

More clearly this would be:

:math:`54 \text{GU} = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{7.0 \text{Gallons}}`

Solving for this equation means we expect the total points to be 378 GU.
We're going to aim to get this many points from the recipe, but that is
highly dependent on the Brew House Efficiency.

Let's use a Brew House Efficiency of 70% for our example.  That means that we
expect to only extract 70% of the total points from the grain bill's potential
points.  So let's look at what the total points are if we could fully extract
all the sugars from the malts:

:math:`378 \text{GU} \div 70\% \text{BHE} = 540 \text{GU}`

This 540 Points is what we're going to aim for in building our grain bill.

Picking the Amount
------------------

In our Pale Ale example we are going to use two grains, a 2-row pale malt as
the primary grain and a crystal 20L malt for flavor. The pale malt is going
to make up 95% of our total grain bill and the crystal 20L is going to make up
the remaining 5%.

To determine the amount of the primary grain we must know the potential extract
of the grain in Points Per Gallon (PPG).  The pale malt is listed as having a
potential of 37 PPG.  Let's determine what that means in terms of pounds of
malt.

:math:`540 \text{GU} \times 95\% = 513 \text{GU}`

Now divide the points by the potential to get the weight:

:math:`513 \text{GU} \div 37 \text{PPG} = 13.86 \text{Pounds}`

Repeating this math for the crystal 20L malt we get:

:math:`27 \text{GU} \div 35 \text{PPG} = 0.73 \text{Pounds}`

Now we know exactly how much of each grain will go into the beer.
