Designing the Grain Bill
========================

This tutorial is going to show you how to design a grain bill for your beer.
Once the style is known you will want to decide how much of each grain to add
to get the Original Gravity you desire.  This can be done in a few easy steps.

Picking Original Gravity
------------------------

If we build a Pale Ale we might first want to pick an original gravity.  This
would be the driven primarily by the style of the beer and for a Pale Ale we
will pick 1.053.  This is the gravity you desire after you have steeped your
grains and added your malt extract.  This is largely driven by your Brew House
Efficiency and the types of grain you use (cereals, malt extracts, etc).

Let's use a Brew House Efficiency of 70% for our example.  That means that we
expect to only extract 70% of the total points from the grain bill's potential
points.  So let's look at what the total points are:

:math:`\text{OG} = \text{BHE} * \text{Total Points}`

More clearly this would be:

:math:`53 \text{GU} = 0.70 * \text{Total Points}`

Solving for this equation means we expect to get 76 GU.  But this is not the
total points of the extract.  To get that you must multiply by the final volume
of the recipe, in this case 5 Gallons.

:math:`76 \text{GU} \times 5 \text{Gallons} = 380 Points`

This 380 Points is what we're going to aim for in building our grain bill.

Picking the Amount
------------------

In our Pale Ale example we are going to use two grains, a 2-row pale malt as
the primary grain and a crystal 20L malt for flavor. The pale malt is going
to make up 95% of our total grain bill and the crystal 20L is going to make up
the remaining 5%.

To determine the amount of the primary grain we must know the potential extract
of the grain in Points Per Gallon (PPG).  The pale malt is listed as having a
potential of 37 PPG.  Let's determine what that means in terms of pounds of
malt.

:math:`380 \text{Points} * 95% = 365.75 \text{Points}`

Now divide the points by the potential to get the weight:
