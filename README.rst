Brew Day
========

This repositiory is a set of utilities for the homebrewer. It should
help in constructing and analyzing recipes. There are also command line
utilities for brew day.

The hope is to help improve your planning and execution when making
beer.

Recipe Examples
===============

To see examples of this library in action check out the ``examples/``
directory or read the `Example README.md <./examples/README.md>`__ for
more information.

Tools
=====

To be helpful a few tools have been included. Run them thusly:

.. code:: sh

    $ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH: python bin/abv -h
    $ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH: python bin/sugar -h
    $ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH: python bin/temp -h
    $ PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH: python bin/yeast -h

Charts
======

In an attempt to understand the data as it is presented in various
brewing books and websites the ``charts/`` directory attempts to
reproduce them using the tools of this library. Credit is given as best
as possible to the original author. Corrections are made where possible
to make the charts as accurate as possible.

A note on Graphs
----------------

Importantly these charts are generally lists of numbers and NOT graphs.
To limit the required dependencies of this library any graphs are kept
in the `BrewSci <https://github.com/chrisgilmerproj/brewsci>`__ repo.

Data
====

The ``data/`` directory holds data used by parsers in the repo to build
recipes. The data was gathered using Scrapy to gather info from
different brewing websites. The scraping code exists there along with
the following data dirs:

-  ``cereals/``
-  ``hops/``
-  ``water/``
-  ``yeast/``

All the data is formatted in ``*.json`` files. The files are guaranteed
to work with the parsers in this library.

Units
=====

The standard for this repository at the moment is to use Imperial Units.
This is because most of the equations used as reference use Imperial
Units. As tests are updated units may change to SI Units (metric).

Percentages
===========

A fair number of methods require input values as a percentage. To avoid
confusion all percentages are expected to be in decimal form between the
number 0.0 and 1.0.

Percentages will be displayed in percentage format as opposed to decimal
format to avoid confusion and for ease of reading.

Documentation
=============

Change to the ``docs`` directory. Then do the following:

.. code:: sh

    $ cd docs/
    $ virtualenv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    (.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    (.venv) $ pip install -r requirements-local.txt --upgrade
    (.venv) $ make html
    (.venv) $ open build/index.html

It's important that the current version of the library be installed in
order to generate the API docs. To insure this insure to install from
``requirements-local.txt`` with the ``--upgrade`` flag every time.
Example:

.. code:: sh

    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    (.venv) $ pip install -r requirements-local.txt --upgrade
    (.venv) $ make html
